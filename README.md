# Snake Game

This is a simple snake game built in Go. It was created as a project to learn the basics of Go programming language while having fun.

## Code Overview

The game is structured into three main files:

- **main.go**: Contains the main entry point of the program, which sets up the terminal screen and listens for user input to control the snake.
- **game.go**: Defines the `Game` struct and its associated methods for managing the game state and rendering it on the terminal screen.
- **snake.go**: Handles the inner state of the snake object, including its position and movement logic.

## How to Run

To run the snake game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).

2. Clone or download the repository containing the snake game code.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the code in your terminal.

4. Run the following command to compile and execute the game:
   _go run main.go_

5. Once the game starts, you can use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake. Try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake itself!

Enjoy playing the snake game and exploring the basics of Go programming language!
